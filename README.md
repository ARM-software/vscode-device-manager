# Arm Device Manager

## Overview

The complete [documentation](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/108029/latest/Extension-pack-and-extensions) for Arm® Device Manager and the other Keil® Studio extensions is available on Arm Developer.

The Device Manager extension allows you to manage hardware connections for Arm Cortex®-M based microcontrollers, development boards, and debug probes. You can install the extension individually or as part of the Arm Keil Studio Pack extension in Visual Studio Code Desktop.

We recommend installing the [Keil Studio Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Arm.keil-studio-pack) for Visual Studio Code Desktop to quickly set up your environment. You can then [import a solution example from keil.arm.com](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/108029/latest/Get-started-with-an-example-project/Import-a-solution-example), [download a μVision project from keil.arm.com](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/108029/latest/Get-started-with-an-example-project/Download-a-Keil--Vision-example), [create a solution from scratch](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/108029/latest/Arm-CMSIS-Solution-extension/Create-a-solution), or [convert an existing μVision project](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/108029/latest/Arm-CMSIS-Solution-extension/Convert-a-Keil--Vision-project-to-a-solution).

The Device Manager extension works with the Arm CMSIS Solution (Identifier: `arm.cmsis-csolution`) and the Arm Debugger (Identifier: `arm.arm-debugger`) extensions to run and debug solutions.
